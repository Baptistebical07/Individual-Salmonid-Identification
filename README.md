# Individual-Salmonid-Identification
Code and data for identification of individual Trout and Graylings

**Code** Cleaned_ResNet_Rasp.py
*Contains code for algorithm used for individual classification. I use ResNet50, with pre-trained weights of ImageNet.*

**Data set** 
test_set_1_metadata.csv
*Contains paths for a first test dataset, not similar to the training and validation datasets. Is expected to show the generalization quality of the model.*

test_set_2_metadata.csv
*Contains paths for a second dataset, more similar to the training and validation datasets. Is expected to show the accuracy of the model.*

train_metadata.csv
*Contains paths for the train dataset.*

validation_metadata.csv
*Contains paths for the validation dataset.*
